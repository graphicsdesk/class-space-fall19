# Class Space Fall 2019

Mapping class space for classes in Fall 2019. Make sure to keep the data (mainly `/Users/jasonkao/cs_projects/building_counts.csv`) outside of this repository.

I initially used `building_key.json` to map the names in Vergil to the IDs of building polygons (I think from OSM, maybe from Microsoft).
