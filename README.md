# Class Space Fall 2019

Mapping class space for classes in Fall 2019. Make sure to keep the data (mainly `/Users/jasonkao/cs_projects/building_counts.csv`) outside of this repository.

I initially used `building_key.json` to map the names in Vergil to the IDs of building polygons (I think from OSM, maybe from Microsoft).

## Illustrator files

* `fourt-draft.ai`: The final draft
* `fourth-draft backup.ai`: Looks like an uncropped version of the final draft?
* `first-draft.ai`: First try at matching numbers to polygons.
* `g-earth.ai`: 3D (not bird's eye) view
   * `g-earth.jpg`: Background image embed
* `map-extent.png`: Not sure if this is being used
